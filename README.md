  <strong>Climate Change Analysis</strong>
</h1>
<p align="center"><b>By Vishal Wagadre</b></p>

## About the Project 
This initiative offers an extensive, multi-faceted dataset monitoring crucial climate change indicators on a worldwide scale. It encompasses time series data on changes in surface temperature, rising sea levels, atmospheric CO₂ levels, land cover statistics, forest and carbon reserves, as well as the occurrence of climate-related disasters. The information is obtained from renowned organizations like FAO and NOAA, and is structured for research or analytical purposes.  

#### Features
1. Historical annual and monthly data on climate indicators, from the 1960s to 2025.  
2. Global surface temperature anomalies by country and region.  
3. Global and regional sea level rise statistics.  
4. Frequency and impact of climate-related natural disasters.  
5. Forest area, carbon stocks, and indices of land cover and climate regulation.  
6. Atmospheric CO₂ (ppm) monthly trend time series.
